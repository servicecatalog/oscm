# Re-compile Branding Package with the use of Koala

Koala is a standalone GUI application that lets you compile easily Sass files and generate css files and their minified versions.

It also supports other pre-processor languages such as Compass, Less or CoffeeScript and supports the compilation and minification of js files.

**Step 1:** Download the Koala APP from the official website: [http://koala-app.com/](http://koala-app.com/)

Koala runs on Windows, Linux and Mac. Install it on Windows by following the Installation wizard steps. Koala can be directly used after installation.

**Step 2:** Open the Koala GUI and drag-and-drop the extracted branding-package folder into the window (or click on the `+` icon).

Now the `branding-package` project file structure appears:

Notice that by default the output path (grey files with edit icon) of the generated `.css` files is the same directory as the one of the `.scss` files.

We will change the output directories in the next step by using project settings (alternatively you can select each file and click on the &quot;edit&quot; icon to set its output path).

**Step 3:** Output the generated `.css` files into the `customBootstrap/css` folder (the output directory for custom bootstrap) and `css` folder (the output directory for `mp.css`), by using the project configuration settings.

Right-click on the `branding-package` project and choose `Project Settings --> New settings --> For Sass`.

Koala will create a `koala-config.json` file under you project directory. You can edit it and set custom settings.

Edit the `mappings` section as follows:

```
// The mappings of source directory and output directory
	

     "mappings": [
		 {
		 	"src": "customBootstrap/scss",
		 	"dest": "customBootstrap/css"
		 },
            {
		 	"src": "scss",
		 	"dest": "css"
		 } 
	],
```

And now right-click on the project: `branding-package` and then `Reload` to reload the project with the modified `koala-config.json` configuration file.

The custom output directories are updated:

**Step 4:** Set the &quot;Auto Compile&quot; Option to automatically compile the files when they change.

**Step 5:** Compile the minified (compressed) versions: `customTheme.min.css` and `mp.min.css`.

Open `koala-config.json` by navigating to: `Project Settings --> Edit settings`.

if you have .css in the ignores property, remove it:
```"ignores": []```

Now all CSS files and their compile options appear when selecting the &quot;CSS&quot; tab on the bottom right of the window.

If not already defined so, set the output path of `customTheme.css` to `customTheme.min.css` in the same directory. Similarly set the minified output files for all .css files.

Lastly compile `customTheme.css` to `customTheme.min.css`. Select `customTheme.css` then select the `yuicompress` Output Style, and click on the `Compile` button.

You&#39;re done! These steps should do all the job for the re-compilation of your custom branding package!
