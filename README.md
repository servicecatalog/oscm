Open Service Catalog Manager (OSCM) is an open source application with enterprise quality level. It supports a bright spectrum of use cases, from SaaS Marketplaces to Enterprise IaaS Stores. It offers ready-to-use service provisioning adapters for IaaS providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and OpenStack, but is also open for integrating other platforms.

Service Providers can define their services with flexible price models and publish them to an OSCM Marketplaces. The Service Provider can decide on using the OSCM Billing Engine for the service usage cost calculation, or integrate an external one. Customers can subscribe to and use the services.

## Getting started and building from sources
Please follow this guide from top to bottom, this is the easiest way to avoid errors later on.

#### Prerequisites
Basic:
* Installed [JDK 8u121](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html#jdk-8u121-oth-JPR)
or higher.
* [Apache Ivy 2.4.0](http://www.apache.org/dist/ant/ivy/2.4.0/) library.
* [Eclipse ECJ 4.5.1](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler/ecj/4.5.1) library.

#### Setting up a workspace
1. Download the latest sources for [this](https://github.com/servicecatalog/oscm). 
2. Import the project into your IDE. You should adjust some of the preferences:
  * Set the compiler level to the installed version of Java 1.8.
  * Set UTF-8 file encoding and Unix line endings.
3. Import and configure the code formatting rules and code templates.
  * Download the files from the [codestyle folder](https://github.com/servicecatalog/oscm/tree/master/oscm-devruntime/javares/codestyle).
  * Import them into your Eclipse IDE ([Help](https://github.com/servicecatalog/oscm/tree/master/oscm-devruntime/javares/codestyle/README.md))
  * Configure the formatting for non-Java files ([Rules and Help](https://github.com/servicecatalog/oscm/tree/master/oscm-devruntime/javares/codestyle/README.md))

#### Setting up the mail server
1. Download and install any mail server.
2. Create any domain and at least one user account in it.

#### Building the application
1. Install `sass` and add it to your PATH - for details see [sass-lang](https://sass-lang.com/install)

2. If your network requires a proxy to access the internet you need to specify following arguments to JVM running Ant: 
   ```
   -Dhttp.proxyHost=<proxy-host> 
   -Dhttp.proxyPort=<proxy-port> 
   -Dhttps.proxyHost=<proxy-host>
   -Dhttps.proxyPort=<proxy-port>
   ```
   Fill the placeholders `<proxy-host>` and `<proxy-port>` with the respective host and port number where the proxy is provided.

3. Add the following scripts to Ant view in your IDE: `/oscm-devruntime/build-oscmaas.xml`

4. Run targets `Build.LIB`, `Build.BES`

After the build has finished successfully you'll find the deployable artifacts in`/oscm-build/result/package`. 
You may want to deploy and test your modifications in a running OSCM environment. Simply copy or replace your build artifact into the respective container.

For example:
```
docker cp /workspace/oscm-build/result/package/oscm-portal/oscm-portal.war oscm-core:/opt/apache-tomee/webapps/
```

#### Deploying the application
